## Flight Ticket Price Analysis with Python

### Overview

This project explores how flight ticket prices are influenced by various factors, such as:

* Source and Destination cities
* Airline
* Departure and Arrival time (Morning, Evening, etc.)
* Class (Economy or Business)
* Booking duration (days before departure)

The analysis is done using Python in a Jupyter Notebook and includes data cleaning, grouping, and insightful visualizations to answer key business questions.

---

### Key Business Questions Answered

1. What are the airlines in the dataset and their frequencies?
2. How are departure and arrival times distributed across flights?
3. What are the most common Source and Destination cities?
4. Does ticket price vary across different airlines?
5. Is ticket price affected by **departure and arrival time**?
6. How does ticket price change with different **Source and Destination** pairs?
7. How is ticket price affected when booked just 1 or 2 days before the flight?
8. What’s the price difference between **Economy** and **Business class**?
9. What is the **average price** of a **Vistara Business Class** flight from **Delhi to Hyderabad**?

---

### Tools Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis environment

---

### Visualizations

The project includes:

* Bar charts (Airline frequency, Source/Destination cities, Departure/Arrival times)
* Comparative bar plots and boxplots for prices by airline, class, and timing
* Heatmaps to explore pricing by source-destination combinations
* Trend analysis on how prices vary based on booking timing


---

### Insights Summary

* Prices vary significantly across **airlines** and **flight classes**
* **Business class** flights are consistently more expensive, as expected
* **Last-minute bookings** (1–2 days before) cost much more on average
* **Departure and arrival times** influence ticket pricing — peak hours are costlier
* The **average price of a Vistara Business Class** flight from **Delhi to Hyderabad** is approximately ₹XX,XXX

### How to Run This Project

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-price-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder and open the notebook:

```bash
cd flight-price-analysis
jupyter notebook
```

3. Run `Flight Data Analysis.ipynb` to explore the analysis step-by-step.

---

### Dataset

* The dataset includes columns like: `Airline`, `Source_City`, `Destination_City`, `Departure_Time`, `Arrival_Time`, `Duration`, `Class`, and `Price`.

---

### Future Improvements

* Add interactive dashboard with **Streamlit** or **Power BI**
* Build a **machine learning model** to predict ticket prices
* Deploy as a web app for real-time price analysis
